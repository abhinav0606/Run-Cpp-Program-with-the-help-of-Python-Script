# Run-Cpp-Program-with-the-help-of-Python-Script
I have a academic assignment regarding threads that i have to implement with the help of cpp
and note the execution time,so the assignment needs 100 observations 
so i developed a python script that will help us to implement the cpp program as many times as we want

I also used xlsxwriter to write a excell file to store the hundred observations
Requirements:

os module
subprocess module
xlsxwriter module
